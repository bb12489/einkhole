# einkhole

This is a quickly hacked-together Python script for displaying pihole statistics on a Waveshare 2.13 inch e-ink display plugged in as a hat on my Raspberry Pi Zero W.

Use at your own peril!!! :)

Seriously though, make sure you follow these guidelines:

1. Set up the display as described in the Waveshare resources and use the test examples before installing my script (resource link below)
2. Be sure to install all Python packages needed for the script to run
3. Customize to your heart's content!
